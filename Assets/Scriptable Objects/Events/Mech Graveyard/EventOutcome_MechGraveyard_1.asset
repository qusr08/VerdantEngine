  resultWindowText: 'You sweep through the graveyard like a storm of vines and steel,
    pulling copper veins from the husks and stripping plating from broken limbs.
    The mechs offer no resistance - just hollow silence and brittle bones.

    Somewhere
    beneath your feet, something groans. Not alive. Just the dirt, settling.

    You
    leave with your bounty, and behind you, the battlefield sinks an inch deeper
    into the past.

    (Gained scrap)'
