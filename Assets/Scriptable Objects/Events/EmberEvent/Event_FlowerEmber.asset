  title: Wierd Ember
  text: "At the edge of a scorched pit, you find strange flowers\u2014withered yet
    preserved, encased in sharp, ember-like shells as if fossilized by fire. The
    heat is intense, and the air hums with an unnatural energy. Near the rim, a common
    bloom rests safely within reach, its ember casing cracked and cooling. But deeper
    within the pit, rarer flowers lie buried in glowing embers, untouched and dangerous."
