  title: The Broadcast Tower
  text: "A rusted radio tower juts from the ground like a splintered bone. As you
    approach, you realize that the radio tower is still emitting a signal. You direct
    the mech's instruments to tune in to the broadcast, causing your screens to flicker
    to life. A human face flickers into focus - looped endlessly from a time long
    past. \"Keep calm. Help is coming,\" it repeats.\r\r"
