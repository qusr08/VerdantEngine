  resultWindowText: 'At the base of the relay, nestled in a nest of tangled wires
    and corroded metal, a single flower sways gently, its petals flickering faintly
    in time with the transmission.

    You pluck it carefully. The moment it leaves
    the circuit, the signal dies.

    The screen goes dark. The voice is gone.

    But
    the flower hums quietly in your garden now - charged with memory, or maybe just
    static.

    (Gain a Power Flower)'
