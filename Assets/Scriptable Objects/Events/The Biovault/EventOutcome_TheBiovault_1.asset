  resultWindowText: 'You back away from the twitching pod, its petals scraping faintly
    against the glass. Further down the row, you find a smaller container - cracked
    but stable.

    Inside grows a quiet thing, brittle but alive, still clinging
    to its nutrient gel like a child to its cradle.

    You take it with care.
    It does not glow. It does not bite.

    But it lives. And that is enough.

    (Gained
    a plant)'
