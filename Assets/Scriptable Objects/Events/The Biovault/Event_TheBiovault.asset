  title: The Biovault
  text: "You discover a sealed underground chamber with biohazard symbols still visible
    through the rust. Inside are rows of pods, many shattered. But one pod still
    pulses faintly, its glass warped by the pressure of a living thing within. Coiled
    in nutrient fluid lies a mutated flytrap - Its petals twitch with unnatural rhythm,
    its spiked mouth closed tight around something that faintly glows. Its roots
    shudder when it senses your presence, stretching toward the glass. The console
    beside it reads: \"Specimen #039: CARNIFLORA // DO NOT ENGAGE.\"\r\r"
