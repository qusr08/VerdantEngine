  resultWindowText: 'Your vines encircle the flamingo''s legs. The plastic is warm
    - unnaturally so. As you lift, a tremor runs through your chassis.

    The flamingo
    slides free with unsettling ease.

    You secure it among your garden. The relic
    remains motionless, its pink hue stark against the vibrant green.

    Yet, at
    times, you sense a subtle shift in its posture. Perhaps it''s simply the dirt
    shifting as it jostles with every step. Still, you cannot shake the feeling that
    it watches you.

    (Gained Dr. Flamingo)'
