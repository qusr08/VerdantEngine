  title: The Pink Sentinel
  text: "In the middle of a collapsed suburb, surrounded by twisted fences and ash-covered
    lawns, a single plastic flamingo stands perfectly upright. Untouched by rust,
    time, or war. Sun-bleached and glowing faintly pink in the gloom.\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t
    be here. Not after all this time. The wind is dead still, yet the flamingo gently
    sways. The earth beneath it is blackened, scorched into a perfect ring around
    its base. The garden stirs atop the mech - some of your plants lean subtly toward
    it\u2026 others recoil.\r\r\r"
