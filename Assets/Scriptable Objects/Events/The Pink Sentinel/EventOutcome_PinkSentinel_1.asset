  resultWindowText: 'You turn from the flamingo, its presence lingering in your sensors
    like a phantom. As you retreat, the air grows colder, and the silence deepens.

    Behind
    you, the flamingo continues its gentle sway, untouched by time, a solitary sentinel
    in a forgotten suburb.

    Your garden remains still, the moment passing without
    further incident. Yet, a subtle unease settles within you, as if you''ve left
    something important behind.

    (Nothing happens... For now)'
