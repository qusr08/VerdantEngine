  resultWindowText: "You extend your roots, cautiously threading them into the soft,
    glowing soil. The moment they reach the node, the world quiets.\r\nA pulse. Then
    another.\r\nThe crater breathes with you, through you - flushing your systems
    with warmth, tranquility, and a hum too low to be heard.\r\nLife surges into
    your limbs, mending battered bark and shriveled leaves. You feel serenity, blooming
    quietly in your core, as if the world itself has paused to listen.\r\nYou pull
    back whole. The glow lingers in your roots, and something in you feels\u2026
    Less alone.\r\n(You've healed to full)"
