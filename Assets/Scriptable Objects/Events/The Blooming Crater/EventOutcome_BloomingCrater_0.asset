  resultWindowText: "A tendril detaches from the mass, drifting toward you like a
    curious hand. Its movement is slow - deliberate - and when it brushes against
    your shell, your vines recoil, then reach back.\r\nContact.\r\nThe plant folds
    inward, shrinking into a tight bulb. It presses into your chassis, embedding
    itself like a seed finding soil.\r\nIt makes no sound, but its memories flow
    through you.\r\nSomething new has joined your garden. Something older than you.\r\n(Gained
    a plant)\r\r\r"
