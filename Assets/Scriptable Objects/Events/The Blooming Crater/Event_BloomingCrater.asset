  title: The Blooming Crater
  text: "You stumble upon a crater filled with radiant, bioluminescent plant life.
    Strange tendrils dance in the air like jellyfish tentacles, casting shifting
    shadows on the broken ground. The crater pulses with color - soft pinks, violent
    blues, and deep, whispering greens. It feels alive. As you approach in your metal
    husk, the tendrils turn toward you. They are not hostile. They\u2019re\u2026
    trying to communicate.\nYour vines twitch in sympathy, unsure whether this is
    kinship or mimicry. At the center of the crater, something glows brighter than
    the rest: a pulsating node that seems to breathe.\r\r\r\r"
